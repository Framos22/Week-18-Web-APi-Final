# Week-18-Web-APi-Final
This is my final project for the Promineo Tech Backend course andI have created a simple music database for my final. 
All instructions on how this final was created will be listed below.

** How to Get Started -- Guidelines (first steps to start your Final Project):

Create your project in STS (or an IDE of your choice). Create the basic package structure for all of the layers (e.g. controller, service, DAO, entity, errorhandling, etc.).
Create the entry point for your project.
Create an Interface for each implemented class in the programming layers.
Modify the OpenAPIDocumentation in the Controller Interface to represent the correct responses for each of your operations. (e.g. @GetMapping expects an HTTPStatus.OK, but a @PostMapping expects an HTTPStatus.CREATED)
Implement your simplest entities first (no dependencies), and get them working in all layers.
Use jeep-sales as a guide, and build upon what you have already done!
UnitTesting is encouraged, but not required.
Use Swagger to test your API â€” including the OpenAPIDocumentation in the Controller Interface for your Web API, just as was done in jeep-sales! Another testing option is Postman, however, the Swagger interface is quite easy to use.

Database design which contains at least 3 entities and 3 tables
Contains all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update & Delete)
Each entity should have CRUD operations with one entity having all 4 CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update & Delete).
Contains at least 1 one-to-many relationship
Contains at least 1 many-to-many relationship with one or more CRUD operations on this relationship.


I have created a video showcasing my project with all of the requiremnets above, with a link provided.
